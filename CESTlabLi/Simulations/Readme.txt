1. Run read.m in each folder.
2. Compare the 7-pool model simulated residual MT corrected AREXDSP with the modified 3-pool model simulated AREXDSP.
   Close alignment will indicate the accuracy of our DSP method, as shown in Fig.S9.
3. Vary sample parameters to generate simulated results in other figures.
